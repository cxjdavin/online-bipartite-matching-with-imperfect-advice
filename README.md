# Online bipartite matching with imperfect advice

This is the accompanying repository of the paper "Online bipartite matching with imperfect advice". It is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08229](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09784).

Run ./setup.sh then ./run.sh. The plots will be produced and saved in the current folder. We have included a copy of the produced figures here so you may look at the output without running the experiments yourself.
